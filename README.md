# Accumulated Debt Curve

This project aims to measure the accumulated DeFi lending market risks accross multiple chains and markets.

Liquidations are essential to the health of a DeFi lending protocol, the debts they cover can result in a downwards pressure over the price of the underlying assets, causing market slippages and even liquidation cascades.

We can monitor the accumulated debts accross these DeFi lending markets to see where new liquidations would trigger. Moreover, we can apply an slippage model in order to check how these liquidations would further impact the market, and even cause liquidation cascades.
